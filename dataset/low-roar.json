The album's lyrics are inspired by Ryan Karazija's recent divorce and his life as an expatriate in Iceland.[3] One reviewer described the album as \"flow[ing] between dreamy and floating and more solidly rhythmic tracks,\" and another described it as having an \"atmosphere [that] never permits the sun to linger for very long, shutting it out with harsh, icy synth.\" The song ‚ÄúWaiting (10 Years)\" was released as a single.\r\n\nThe opening track, Don't Be So Serious, was used as the opening song for the 2019 game Death Stranding, with many other tracks being featured on the soundtrack as well.",

The album's fifth track was featured in the mobile game Arknights under the title \"Feels.\"\r\n\nIt was the last album released by the band before the death of lead vocalist and founder Ryan Karazija in October of the following year due to complications with pneumonia.",
