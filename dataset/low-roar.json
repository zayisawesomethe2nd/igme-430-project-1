The album's lyrics are inspired by Ryan Karazija's recent divorce and his life as an expatriate in Iceland.[3] One reviewer described the album as \"flow[ing] between dreamy and floating and more solidly rhythmic tracks,\" and another described it as having an \"atmosphere [that] never permits the sun to linger for very long, shutting it out with harsh, icy synth.\" The song ‚ÄúWaiting (10 Years)\" was released as a single.\r\n\nThe opening track, Don't Be So Serious, was used as the opening song for the 2019 game Death Stranding, with many other tracks being featured on the soundtrack as well.",
